# FLAPPY BIRD

Made this right after my first semester. Wanted to try soemthing more challenging after Pong and also wanted to use the pygame library more
extensively, like using sprites and sprite collision.
The game is aimed to be a complete replica of Flappy bird.
Still have to add bird tilt animation while falling.
