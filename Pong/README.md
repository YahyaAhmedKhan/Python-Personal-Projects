# Pong

This was my first proper project done for fun.
Used pygame library. I hadn't learnt to use Sprites in pygame yet so the collision detection was done manually.

The Left paddle is moved using W/D keys and the Right one using the UP/DOWN keys.

0 has to be pressed to start each round and the score is displayed near the bottom.
